# Part-of-Speech-Tagging-Multiple-Models
This repository holds the code for my thesis on "Active Learning and Part of Speech Tagging". This is the first of two parts of code, and explores different models used as Part of Speech Taggers. The models used are: RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Bi-LSTM with CRF layer, CRF, HMM and n-grams. By executing the files main.py, hmm.py and crf.py you can find the accuracy on english and greek on the Universal Dependencies EWT and GDT datasets.
